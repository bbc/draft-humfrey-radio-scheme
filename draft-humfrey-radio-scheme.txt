1.  Introduction

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [RFC5234].

2.  Scheme Syntax

   broadcast-radio-uri = amss-uri / dab-uri / drm-uri / fm-uri
   prefix-delimiter = ":"
   gcc    = 3HEXDIG
   uatype = 3HEXDIG

   gcc:  The Global Country Code of the country of origin of the
      service, which is calculated as described in Annex A of
      [ETSI.TS.103.270]
   uatype:  The user application of the data component, used to identify
      the user application which should be used to decode the data
      indicated by the "service-id" and "scids".  List of valid user
      application types is defined in [ETSI.TS.101.756] Section 5.10.

Internet-Draft              Radio URI Schemes              December 2019


2.1.  The AM Signalling System (AMSS) Scheme

   AM Signalling System [ETSI.TS.102.386] URI scheme comprises only of
   the Service Identifier.

   amss-uri    = amss-prefix amss-sid
   amss-prefix = "amss" prefix-delimiter
   amss-sid    = 6HEXDIG

   amss-sid:  The Service Identifier of the service

2.2.  The Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) Scheme

dab-uri    = dab-prefix gcc "."  eid "." dab-sid "." scids [ "." uatype ]
dab-prefix = "dab" prefix-delimiter
dab-sid    = 4HEXDIG / 8HEXDIG
eid        = 4HEXDIG
scids      = 1HEXDIG

   eid:  The Ensemble Identifier of the service
   scids:  The Service Component Identifier with the Service

2.3.  The Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) Scheme

   drm-uri    = drm-prefix drm-sid [ "." appdomain "." uatype ]
   drm-prefix = "drm" prefix-delimiter
   drm-sid    = 6HEXDIG
   appdomain  = 1HEXDIG

   appdomain:  The application domain of the data component
   drm-sid:  The Service Identifier of the service

2.4.  The VHF/FM URI Scheme

   fm-uri    = fm-prefix gcc "." pi "." frequency
   fm-prefix = "fm" prefix-delimiter
   pi        = 4HEXDIG
   frequency = 5DIGIT / "*"

   pi:  Received RDS/RBDS Programme Identification (PI) code
   frequency:  Frequency on which the broadcast is received, formatted
      to 5 characters in units of 100 KHz.  Frequencies below 100 MHz
      MUST include a leading zero, for example 90.2 MHz would be
      represented as "09020".

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document kindly requests the following existing URI Schemes be
   updated so their references now refer to this document:

   o  amss
   o  dab
   o  drm
   o  fm

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
